Here is an example of benefits of open architectures.<br /><br />The upcoming OpenMoko phone (named '<a href="http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Neo_FreeRunner">Neo FreeRunner</a>' or GTA02 architecture) is going to have an <a href="http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Neo_FreeRunner_GTA02_Hardware#Accelerometer">accelerometer</a>. Someone started a thread about how one can make use of this new piece of hardware. So far there have been many replies on the thread and they have very innovative ideas.<br /><br />My favorite one, <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.handhelds.openmoko.community/10405">a suggestion</a> from Crane, Matthew:<br /><blockquote>... if the device:<br />        - goes from 60km+ to 0 in short order, e.g. high g stop<br />        - while traveling horizontally<br />        - over a road<br />        - an on-screen alert/countdown is not stopped<br />Then it's likely a vehicular accident so auto-call/sms for help with<br />some kind of countdown to disable.  Only really possible to do that with<br />a phone + GPS + acell.</blockquote>Check out the rest <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.handhelds.openmoko.community/10393">here</a>.</div>
