It's pretty frustrating to see this error in iTunes when you have spent a long time downloading some stuff over a slow network. You hit that re-download button, hoping that it will just immediately mark it alright after it has found the already downloaded content, but it starts the download all over again.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oYpX_9in_Bc/T3cMJmz588I/AAAAAAAAEEM/QG_8kRIgxu8/s1600/Screen+shot+2012-03-31+at+7.15.09+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="74" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oYpX_9in_Bc/T3cMJmz588I/AAAAAAAAEEM/QG_8kRIgxu8/s320/Screen+shot+2012-03-31+at+7.15.09+PM.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Don't click that re-download icon.<br /><br />In my case when I saw the above error after the download was complete, I found the files hidden in the iTunes folder. I could copy them elsewhere and open the content in VLC.<br /><br />The folder you will find it in is <br /><pre>$HOME/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/*</pre></div>
