As per the <a href="http://jyro.blogspot.com/2009/02/planning-inkface-v02.html">plan</a> for v0.2, I am ready with a working implementation of inkface. I also made few more design decisions after my last design post. Here are the highlights:<br /><br />1. All code is in python<br />2. For X11 surfaces, pygame is used.<br /><br />I found that pygame (python bindings for SDL) is a mature library for drawing on X11 surfaces. It also has some optimizations which help in 2D animations. There is also OpenGL support, but I do not plan to use it inside inkface library. It is also well supported on Maemo.<br /><br />I have written my favorite twitter client app with the new inkface-pygame library. The following video demo shows, how I could quickly code 2D scrolling animation with the help of pygame.<br /><br /><embed src="http://blip.tv/play/Ae+kOAA" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="634" width="700"></embed><br /><br />The v0.2.0 is delivered as a <a href="http://altcanvas.googlecode.com/files/inkface-pygame_0.2.0.tar.gz">tarball</a>. I have also updated the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/altcanvas/wiki/InkFace">inkface wiki</a> with some getting-started tips.</div>
