With all the debate going over TSA's naked scanners and intimate pat-downs, I think one simple question is being totally ignored.<br /><br />Why secure the entire airport when it's only the planes that fly in the sky. The reason we need added security for air travel is their unique vulnerability as compared to other forms of transport. An accident or attack in mid-air can lead to nearly 100% fatality. Also planes can be used as weapons in even more significant disasters as demonstrated by 9/11. So the objective of securing air travel should be to keep the flying objects safe. Anything and anyone that boards the airliner should be thoroughly checked. But why secure the entire airport?<br /><br />Airport is tens of square miles of area with hundreds of access points. To try to secure this entire area is to make the task at hand enormously difficult than it has to be. There is nothing more special about an airport than is about Grand central railway station. A terrorist group is not going to achieve anything more significant by blasting a bomb at airport gate than he would by blasting it on a railway platform. Consequently, security of airport can be as tight (or loose) as that of a railway station. All the extra vigilance however should be concentrated at the gates where passengers and crew board the airplane - the real vulnerable entity that needs protection.<br /><br />It is a matter of common sense that smaller the area to protect, more effectively it can be done. Why not apply that to air travel security?<br /><br />Moreover, securing entire airport varies from country to country. Flights fly to US from all over the world, in multiple hops. Securing the safety of a flight bound to US, then depends on securing the boundaries of all the airports where the flight was boarded. Imagine how behemoth that task is and how easy to breach. Establishing the checks at the doors of the actual plane simplifies that problem by magnitudes.</div>

Good day! I&#39;ve been trying to find your exact email but to no avail that&#39;s why I decided to leave a comment on your post<br /><br />This is Emy of Neugent Technologies. <br /><br />At present we are in the midst of creating an Application store for Android™. The Andy brand creates Android™ applications and embedded systems development for smart device and we are testing the Philippine market by launching our first batch of 50,000 units by January and we expect its second batch by February 2011.<br /><br />In line to this, we are very impressed with your application ReaderScope and we would like to put it up in our Andy AppStore. We understand that you are the developer for this application and we want to ask your full permission if we can include and publish it in our Andy AppStore. The Andy AppStore will be integrated in the smart devices we will launch. <br /><br />We believe that it can also be a sort of advertisement for this application by exposing it in our current AppStore and in doing so, it will increase its exposure for your other line up of works.<br />Thank you and hoping for your favorable response.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Emy<br /><br />Emilita V. Castro<br />Marketing Executive<br />Neugent Technologies Inc. for Andy<br />Topy Building I , #3 Economia Street,<br />Bgy. Bagumbayan, Libis, Quezon City,<br />PHILIPPINES<br />Tel.

I think there are some good reasons for conducting those screenings not directly at the gate:<br /><br />Securing each individual gate would probably be more expensive than creating a few artificial bottlenecks at the screening checkpoints.<br /><br />Airlines want their planes to stay on the ground as short as possible, Therefore, boarding needs to be done as fast as possible. <br />Check-in - like security screening - is a bottleneck. Putting two such bottlenecks close to each other without adequate buffer spaces will likely reduce overall passenger throughput.<br /><br />Additionally, shops are a large revenue source for airports. Therefore, it is actually in the interest of the airport to keep passengers there as long as possible.</div>
