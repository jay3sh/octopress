Read this in a Register article today. Most hilarious nerd comment I heard lately:[context - the reporter was at LinuxWorld conference where he saw a FreeBSD booth]<br /><br /><span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span></span>When I approached the FreeBSD booth, my first question was, "So, what's FreeBSD doing here at LinuxWorld?" Without losing a beat, the FreeBSD guy responded, "Actually, in an alternate universe, I'm attending BSDWorld and there's one Linux booth. However, my transporter malfunctioned 'cause it was running Linux, and so here I am." Best nerd one-liner I've heard at the show. <span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;font-family:times new roman;" >"<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span></span>Read the full story at <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/08/19/linuxworld_virtualisation_techs/">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/08/19/linuxworld_virtualisation_techs/</a><br /><span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;font-family:times new roman;" ><br /></span></span></div>
