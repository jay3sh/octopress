Not that I read poetry and understand it. But these are the lyrics of John Mayer's song, that I liked very much. These are some lines from the song that tell the idea...<br /><br />' Just cast away and I am lost at sea oh<br />Another lonely day and no one here but me oh<br />More loneliness than any man could bare<br />Rescue me before I fall into despair   ......<br /><br />I send an S.O.S. to the world<br />I hope that someone gets my<br />Message in a bottle<br /><br />....<br /><br />Walked out this morning I dont believe what I saw<br />A hundred billion bottles washed up on the shore<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Seems I'm not alone at being alone</span><br />A hundred billion castaways all looking for a home'<br /><br /><br />Enjoy!!!!<br /><br />[This and other songs of John Mayer are also good to ears ... give him a try]</div>

Actually, I think this song was originally by the Police:<BR/><BR/>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Police<BR/><BR/>Also, for a more aggresive version of this song, check out Machinehead's cover of it. It's on their "Burning Red" album:<BR/><BR/>http://www.machinehead1.com/discography.html</div>
