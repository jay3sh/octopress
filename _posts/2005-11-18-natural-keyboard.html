I was doing little research on natural keyboards (it's been a while that I have bought some electronic gadget) and I came across some of these amusing facts.<br /><br />This particular <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=19042">article</a> from Inquirer says 'natural' keyboard is a wrong design. I didn't know that shifting to natural keyboard needs some learning (which is apparently less for touch typists).<br /><br />This is another funny <a href="http://www.afrotechmods.com/keyboard.htm">link</a> that tells how to make natural keyboard from regular one.<br /><br />But now I have abondoned the plan of buying a new keyboard. :)</div>
