Today I saw two amazing videos reported on slashdot.<br /><br />The <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2008/01/make_your_own_vaccum_tube.html">first</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span> video is about a french radio operator who makes his own vacuum tubes. This 17-min video is a magic show for a geek. It shows a rare phenomenon when engineering meets craftsmanship. I have always had tough time getting success in hardware projects, so I turned into a software guy over time. That's why I started envying this guy, because there is hardly anything that a software guy can show in a video that will demonstrate the abstractions he visualizes and expresses in his programs.<br /><br />That's when I saw this <a href="http://www.zynamics.com/files/ms08001.swf">second</a> video that shows an analysis of the assembly code that explains the IGMP buffer overflow in Windows kernel. I didn't understand a lot of it, but I liked the way this video helps one visualize the molecular structure of a software program, what we otherwise call assembly code.<br /><br /><br />Enjoy!</div>
