Finally I got it working last night.<br /><br /><object height="355" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/arL_-tQndzI&amp;hl=en"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/arL_-tQndzI&amp;hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="355" width="425"></embed></object><br /><br />After watching the demo of clutter at <a href="http://jyro.blogspot.com/2008/03/osim-usa-2008-day-2.html">OSiM</a> I got interested in the <a href="http://o-hand.com/work/">OpenedHand</a>'s <a href="http://clutter-project.org/">Clutter</a> project. More importantly embedding a browser in cairo is of greater interest to me. So when I got it working, I couldn't help showing it off.</div>

Fortunately I found the tree I had built the demo from. The binary gets created at clutter-webkit/examples/test-webkit. At least this was the location when I had tried few months back. Hope that helps.</div>

I can't seem to get it to work - I installed clutter, clutter-cairo, and webkit-clutter, but where is the executable file that starts the browser?</div>
