Search box is implicit for any Google product. Google Reader offers one too. Searching through your hundreds of feeds, folders is really handy. With v1.2.3 the same search functionality comes to ReaderScope.<div><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_W6UcJjyXr24/StC1ZSi40rI/AAAAAAAADbU/cNeCqudV4ZQ/s1600-h/search2.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 324px; height: 203px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_W6UcJjyXr24/StC1ZSi40rI/AAAAAAAADbU/cNeCqudV4ZQ/s400/search2.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5391008200042009266" /></a><div><br /></div><div><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_W6UcJjyXr24/StC1ZsDSa3I/AAAAAAAADbc/Vfc651uUucs/s1600-h/search1.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 267px; height: 400px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_W6UcJjyXr24/StC1ZsDSa3I/AAAAAAAADbc/Vfc651uUucs/s400/search1.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5391008206888790898" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>You can search through all items, or individual feeds or tags. Pressing search menu button on first screen will let you search through "All items". Pressing search menu button on second screen will let you search through whatever feed or tag you are browsing on that screen currently. The search box will indicate the scope of your search.</div><div><br /></div><div>Besides this feature, the functionality of updating the unread counts is implemented completely in this version. In v1.2.2 only the GUI was updated to reflect changes in unread counts. But actual update in database was disabled because of performance issues. In v1.2.3 the syncing with database is deferred till the end. So now you will see a "Syncing database" progress dialog before you close the app.</div><div><br /></div><div>In v1.2.2, some fixes went in that take care of crashes people were seeing. No obvious crashes have been reported since, so I hope everything is going well. BTW, Did you like the loading screen? :)</div><br /><div></div>Cheers!</div></div>
