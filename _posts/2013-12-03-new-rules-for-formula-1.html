There are many aspects of our culture that can be called flamboyant, lavish and egregiously wasteful; yet we just love them. Take "Formula 1" for example. The amount of fuel these cars burn and the amount of cash their manufacturers spend to design and manufacture them, is shocking. But like many others I am a huge fan of Formula 1 races. Almost inhuman speed, unimaginable power, glamorous look and the sound that literally shakes you to the core - what's there not to like. Despite the guilt of burning so much precious fuel, I would definitely want to be in one of these super cars.<br /><br />So this morning, it was very satisfying to read <a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/formula1/25158104" target="_blank">the news about the new F1 rules and the motive behind them</a>. The new rules require the teams to use different engines in the cars (V6 instead of V8). There are more restrictions on the total fuel they can use and the rate at which they can use them. There is more emphasis on use of electric motors (2 instead of 1), or what's called the "Energy recovery system". What's most notable however is the motive behind these new restrictions.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">The idea is to bring F1 into line with cutting-edge road-car technology, and to stimulate research and development in that area.&nbsp;The name of the game is efficiency - using much less fuel to generate the same performance. The idea is to increase fuel efficiency by as much as 40%.</span></blockquote>This is a way of channeling the competition of a sport towards the betterment of our society. The new feats of engineering happen when they are pushed to the limits and then some more. Then over time they become commonplace and part of everyday life - in this case improving the car we drive to the shopping mall.<br /><br />It gives some meaning to our celebration of Formula 1.<br /><br /><br /></div>
