This is generally a technical blog, but some observations, although non-technical, are too interesting to not write about. I love Hollywood movies and I like Matt Damon ones a lot. Until last night however I didn't realize the most interesting pattern in the roles Matt Damon has portrayed over the years. It struck me after I watched Rounders last night.<br /><br />Count the number of movies in which Matt Damon has played a character who is the absolute genius of his field. Here is a list.<br /><ol><li><b>Good Will Hunting</b> A Math Prodigy</li><li><b>The Rainmaker</b> A talented lawyer who wins his first case barely out of the law school and against a behemoth Insurance company.</li><li><b>Rounders</b> A genius poker player</li><li><b>The Talented Mr. Ripley</b> A murderer who is unusually talented in covering his tracks</li><li><b>The Legend of Bagger Vance</b> A prodigy Golf player</li><li><b>The Bourne {Identity, Supremacy, Ultimatum}</b> A one of a kind CIA operative who is absolutely unbeatable</li></ol>He has a thing about playing a genius, doesn't he? And no doubt he is very good at it too. All his characters are thoroughly entertaining and deeply inspirational at the same time.<br /><br />Hoping to see his latest movie soon - <b>Green zone</b>.</div>
