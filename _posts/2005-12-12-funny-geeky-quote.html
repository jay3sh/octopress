During a disussion on Xen-users mailing list, I found this piece of text from Eric Johansson. It is very amusing geeky humoros quote: "yes, I tried the debootstrap route and sat there watching in childlike wonder as it presented me with a <span id="st" name="st" class="st0">rainbow</span> of failures.  Left me muttering something about rocket club open source projects as I am often given to doing lately."<br /><br />On an independent issue, while just logging into blogger.com I realized that the animation on its login page causes firefox to stammer on a linux machine. I say 'stammer' because the username-password I punch gets batched and appear abruptly later.<br /><br />And firefox users! Try Aquatint - a fantastic new theme!</div>
