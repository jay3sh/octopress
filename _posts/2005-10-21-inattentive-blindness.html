A friend showed me this cool video clip.<br /><br />http://viscog.beckman.uiuc.edu/grafs/demos/15.html<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">BUT Before watching it read this</span>: There are two teams of people, one wearing white clothes and other wearing black clothes. Each team has a ball that they throw to another member of the same team. Your job is to find out how many throws does the white team members do.<br /><br />OK, now watch the video.<br /><br />Did you find anything wierd. No? Then go back and watch the video again. But only this time, don't work on counting the number of throws of the balls, just watch the video relaxed.<br /><br />Did you see what you missed first time?<br /><br />Cool... isn't it?<br /><br />Enjoy!!!</div>
