<pre> "...What I think is, it's never<br />too late...or, in my case, too<br />early, to be whoever you want to<br />be...There's no time limit, start<br />anytime you want...change or stay<br />the same...there aren't any<br />rules...We can make the best or<br />worst of it...I hope you make the<br />best...I hope you see things that<br />startle you. Feel things you<br />never felt before. I hope you<br />meet people who have a different<br />point of view. I hope you<br />challenge yourself. I hope you<br />stumble, and pick yourself up. I<br />hope you live the life you wanted<br />to...and if you haven't, I hope<br />you start all over again."<br /><br />- Benjamin Button<br />(Curious Case of Benjamin Button)<br /></pre><br />Today was my last day at my <a href="http://www.vmware.com">day job</a>. From now on I will be devoting all of my time to my <a href="http://code.google.com/p/altcanvas">pet project</a>. I am moving back to my home town Mumbai, after spending 6 wonderful years in US. I will be flying in few hours. Catch you from the other side of the planet!</div>

Jayesh,  All the power to you!   If i could recommend something -- don't waste time.  Every day is precious.  Your window is open.   I'm still wondering about what Robert Frost meant by "the road not taken".   You won't be.   Make a difference!<BR/><BR/>-jason.</div>
