When I was browsing through my camera's memory yesterday, I revisited the videos I had taken during my road trip from MN to CA. Two of them I found worth uploading.<br /><br />The first one I shot in the evening of second day of my drive. I tried to describe it with words in my last post. Here is how it looked like. But it is still far from the actual experience.<br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"> <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/SZDD7eq6WqY"> </param> <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/SZDD7eq6WqY" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"> </embed> </object><br /><br />This one was just something cool to capture in camera.<br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"> <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/QqSuEtF57Uc"> </param> <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/QqSuEtF57Uc" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"> </embed> </object><br /><br />Enjoy!</div>

Actually... the soundtracks weren't added later on. The moments in videos are 100% pure :)</div>
