Just published beta1 of my second Android app - <span style="font-weight: bold;">ReaderScope</span>. It's a Google Reader client for Android.<br /><br />The goal is to develop simple android-native interface for accessing Google Reader. ReaderScope just takes your credentials (login takes place over secure http connection), fetches the data from your Google Reader account and presents it using Android's native GUI elements. Check out the screenshots below. You can also download your favorite feeds in bulk and then read them offline.<br /><br /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf" flashvars="host=picasaweb.google.com&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feat=flashalbum&amp;RGB=0x000000&amp;feed=http%3A%2F%2Fpicasaweb.google.com%2Fdata%2Ffeed%2Fapi%2Fuser%2Fjayeshsalvi%2Falbumid%2F5371329901694487041%3Falt%3Drss%26kind%3Dphoto%26hl%3Den_US" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" height="400" width="600"></embed><br /><br />At present the news items are displayed in text-only format. This minimal approach is suitable for a phone. However, an option to display images is also in the works.<br /><br />Give it a spin and let me know what you think. You can post it in comments here, or tweet them to me (@jyro) or I can check your market comments via cyrket.</div>

Hi Tamim,<br /><br />If I understand your question correctly, you can pre-cache your news with ReaderScope too. Press Menu and goto Settings. There you can schedule downloading of news at periodic intervals. For better results, choose your favorite feeds/labels by pressing the &quot;By Tags&quot; or &quot;By feeds&quot; buttons. News items for these feeds/tags will be downloaded at specified intervals. <br /><br />The favorite feeds will appear at the top next time you start ReaderScope. They will have upto 20 cached news items each.<br /><br />If you don&#39;t want to periodically download, you can also just press &quot;Download now&quot; to do the caching one time. <br /><br />Try it out. Let me know if that&#39;s what you were looking for OR if you meant something else.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

pre caching would be nice! so that you can read the news without an internet connection. Look at the program NewsRob to see what i mean...</div>
