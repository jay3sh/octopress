So here is the post about the <a href="http://twitter.com/jyro/status/1103834627">eureka moment</a> I promised on Twitter.<br /><br />Last week before releasing Inkface v0.1.2 and twitter-inkface client, I was working on submitting the packages in maemo-extras-devel repo. I was following a long list of instructions. Halfway through the list, I noticed that the example package is assumed to have had autotools kind of build framework. One of my packages uses SCons. I had a doubt (yet unconfirmed) that it won't work. So I scratched my head and that brought to the surface one of the ideas I have had at the back of my mind for a long time. Using one of these "cloud" services to host a debian repo.<br /><br />And what cloud service can be better than the one that is absolutely free (for such a low traffic purpose, at least) - Google App Engine. So I went through the basics of Debian repo and put together an app for Google App engine. Under couple of hours, I had my very own Debian repo. (Yeah, that's when I leapt out of my bathtub and ran to twit '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_%28word%29#Archimedes">Eureka Eureka!</a>') That's what you hit when you point your apt-get to repo.altcanvas.com.<br /><br />I have submitted the small script as a <a href="http://appengine-cookbook.appspot.com/recipe/debian-repository-on-top-of-google-code-files/">recipe</a> in Google App Engine cookbook. You can also find <a href="http://code.google.com/p/altcanvas/source/browse/trunk/repoengine/">it</a> in altcanvas source tree.</div>
