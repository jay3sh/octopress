If you read <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/11/20/1330218">this</a> on slashdot this morning you must already know. I just tried it on my Mac OSx and the review is completely true.<br /><br />Starting firefox 2 on my freshly booted MacBook was taking very very long time. It was unusually slow even after compared to sluggishness of firefox on Linux. Don't know why. So when I tried firefox 3 beta 1 on it I could clearly tell the difference. The fire in firefox is back.<br /><br />[The only reason you might want to hold from upgrading just as yet is lack of availability of compatible plugins. As the official release nears, this problem will go away]</div>
