<div class='post'>
Last night I released ReaderScope v1.7.<br /><br />It now comes with a simple yet useful home screen widget.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_W6UcJjyXr24/S2JWgVi-QyI/AAAAAAAADkU/lN-Ietuq1D0/s1600-h/screenshot1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_W6UcJjyXr24/S2JWgVi-QyI/AAAAAAAADkU/lN-Ietuq1D0/s320/screenshot1.png" /></a></div><br />You can tap on the news and it will be opened in the regular viewer that you see in the main app. The icon in the upper left corner, opens the full app. The icon in the lower right corner refreshes the news items in the widget. This refresh icon however, will only work with the <a href="http://market.altcanvas.com/readerscope">Value pack</a> (previously known as Theme pack, it costs only $2.49)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_W6UcJjyXr24/S2JWoKMqhCI/AAAAAAAADkc/zV9YPSnWHMg/s1600-h/screenshot2.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_W6UcJjyXr24/S2JWoKMqhCI/AAAAAAAADkc/zV9YPSnWHMg/s320/screenshot2.png" /></a></div><br /><br />v1.7 comes with more stylized icons. They are also made DPI specific, so users with high DPI devices (Droid, Nexus One), will see better icons now.<br /><br /><br /><br />And last but not the least. In this version I added an Ad-bar on the news reading screen. It is part of the basic free app. You can get rid of it by installing the <a href="http://market.altcanvas.com/readerscope">Value pack</a>.<br /><br /><i>[If you have donated to ReaderScope in the past, you are entitled to a free unlock code of the value pack. I've sent them yesterday to all the three donors. If you haven't received them or having any troubles using them, please let me know.]</i><br /><br />Let me know what you think of the new widget, icons and the ads.<br /><br />Cheers!</div>
