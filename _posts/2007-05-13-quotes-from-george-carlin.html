Here is the <a href="http://blogzarro.com/?p=226">original post</a>.<br /><br />And here are the ones I liked very much:<br /><br />* Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that.<br /><br />* I put a dollar in a change machine. Nothing changed. <br /><br />* No one knows what’s next, but everybody does it.<br /><br />* I’ve never seen a homeless guy with a bottle of Gatorade. <br /><br />* So far, this is the oldest I’ve been.</div>

Glad to see you have finally discovered the magic that is George Carlin! My dad introduced me to him at a young age, and I've been a fan of his since then.</div>
