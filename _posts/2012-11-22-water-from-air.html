It's fascinating how a really simple idea can change life as we know it. Today I read this <a href="http://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=12-P13-00046&amp;segmentID=8">news</a>&nbsp;via slashdot about a new startup <a href="http://www.nbdnano.com/">NBD nano</a>, that is building a device that can extract water from air. The most interesting part is its implications and applications.<div><br /></div><blockquote><i>we can somehow have a way to tap into one of the largest reservoirs of water, and that being the air<br />...<br />And we see this being applicable to anything from marathon runners to people in third world countries, because we realize that water is such a large issue in the world today<br />...<br />Weâ€™re actually investigating a type of device that can be used for drip irrigation. And we are looking to incorporate this in greenhouses or green roofs in the immediate future<br />...<br />We actually see the maritime environment as really a very large market for us because humidity is actually constantly regenerated over a large body of water and then we can pull that humidity from the air to support people who possibly take long trips on yachts, or provide a sort of potable water source that can be run off a solar panel while at sea.</i></blockquote>And the underlying technology seems convincing. Amazing stuff!</div>
