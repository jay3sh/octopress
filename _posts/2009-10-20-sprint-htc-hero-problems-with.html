[<span style="font-weight: bold;">Update</span>: A fix for this problem is released in v1.2.8a. Please update.]<br /><br />In past 2-3 weeks new users of Sprint HTC Hero have been trying ReaderScope. Unfortunately, they hit a crash immediately after they open the app. A lot of them have been helpful in sending the crash reports to me. I have now received over 10-12 such crash reports, all confirmed to be on Sprint HTC Hero devices. <div><br /></div><div>The exception that occurs implies that there is something wrong with one of the XML layout files. In reality, the XML layout in question is a very simple one and hardly seems to be the cause. I have posted the layout to android-developers group for others' review too. Most importantly this exception is not seen on any other handset or emulator.</div><div><br /></div><div>I started a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/bf2ea0e4e7accc11/e86377c78eaa2d37?lnk=gst&amp;q=app+gives+layout+errors#">thread</a> on android-developers group to discuss this issue. Although, there has been no authoritative answer whether this problem is in HTC firmware or not; couple more developers have reported similar issues their apps are seeing only on Sprint HTC Hero.</div><div><br /></div><div>At the moment the only hope I have is next firmware update from HTC for these devices. If anyone has better suggestion, I am all ears.</div><div><br /></div><div>Keep checking the thread mentioned above, or this blog. Hopefully we will find the solution soon. Thanks for using <a href="http://www.altcanvas.com/android/readerscope">ReaderScope</a>. </div></div>
