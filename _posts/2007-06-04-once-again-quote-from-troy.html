Everytime I watch Troy, I find some dialog worth blogging....<br /><br />This one is from Achilles mother Thetis to him when he is deciding to leave for Troy...<br /><br />"If you stay in Larisa......you will find peace.<br />          <br />You will find a wonderful woman.<br />         <br />You will have sons and daughters,and they will have children. And they will love you.<br />When you are gone,they will remember you.<br />         <br />But when your children are dead and their children after them...<br />...your name will be lost.<br /><br /><br />         <br />If you go to Troy......glory will be yours.<br />         <br />They will write stories about your<br />victories for thousands of years.<br /><br />The world will remember your name.<br /><br />But if you go to Troy......you will never come home.<br /><br />For your glory walks hand in hand with your doom.<br />           <br />And I shall never see you again."</div>
