Finally it is ready. Actually it has been ready for more than couple of weeks now, but I wanted to make sure the bugs in my demo app were not due to problems in core library.<br /><br />The demo app is a client I wrote for the Twitter service. The intention was to demonstrate how an intuitive GUI can be designed using an Image editor. With the GUI designed using Inkscape and an off-the-shelf python library to talk to Twitter service (Thanks to DeWitt for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/">python-twitter</a>), I only had to write simple glue code to get the whole app working. Check out the video.<br /><br /><embed src="http://blip.tv/play/AeXCJQA" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="300" width="500"></embed><br /><br />Good news is I have setup a debian repo to host packages for this app.<br /><br />In the Maemo Application Manager, add following Catalog:<br /><br />Name: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Altcanvas</span><br />Web Address: <span style="font-weight: bold;">http://repo.altcanvas.com</span><br />Distribution: <span style="font-weight: bold;">testing</span><br />Components: <span style="font-weight: bold;">main</span><br /><br />Refresh the application list. You should see '<span style="font-weight: bold;">twitter-inkface</span>' app in the list. All the dependencies will be automatically pulled from the repo.<br /><br />Since the repository implementation is currently experimental (No it's not a standard web server! I will save it for a separate post), you may face a problem while installing or I may have to take it offline for modifications. In that case, you can download following four packages and install them with dpkg ("dpkg -i *.deb")<br /><br /><a href="http://altcanvas.googlecode.com/files/libaltsvg_0.1.2_armel.deb">libaltsvg</a>,<a href="http://altcanvas.googlecode.com/files/inkface-python_0.1.2_armel.deb">inkface-python</a>, <a href="http://altcanvas.googlecode.com/files/inklib_0.1.0.deb">inklib</a>, <a href="http://altcanvas.googlecode.com/files/twitter-inkface_0.1.0.deb">twitter-inkface</a>.<br /><br />For more info on Inkface project, visit the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/altcanvas/wiki/InkFace">project page</a>.</div>
