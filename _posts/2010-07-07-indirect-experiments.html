I like how some advanced experiments in science are fantastically indirect. Take for example this experiment of measuring mass of proton (<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/07/100707-science-proton-smaller-standard-model-quantum-physics/?source=link_tw07072010e">source</a>).<br /><br /><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">For each hydrogen atom, the team replaced the atom's electron with a particle called a muon, which is 200 times more massive than an electron.</span></blockquote><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">"Because the muon is so much heavier, it orbits very close to the proton, so it is sensitive to the proton's size," said team member Aldo Antognini, of the Paul-Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.</span></blockquote><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">Muons are unstable, and they decay into other particles in just 2.2 microseconds. The team knew that firing a laser at the atom before the muon decays should excite the muon, causing it to move to a higher energy levelâ€”a higher orbit around the proton. The muon should then release the extra energy as x-rays and move to a lower energy level.</span></blockquote><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">The distance between these energy levels is determined by the size of the proton, which in turn dictates the frequency of the emitted x-rays.</span></blockquote><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">But based on the accepted proton radius, the experiment failed to produce x-rays at the anticipated frequency.</span></blockquote></div>
