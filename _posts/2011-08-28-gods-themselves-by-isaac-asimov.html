It didn't disappoint me. OTOH it turned out to be one of the best scifi novels I've ever read.<br /><br /><br />It takes real imaginative power and also thorough knowledge of science and technology to weave a story around them. <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16667.Isaac_Asimov" title="Isaac Asimov">Asimov</a> has tackled three extremely imaginative topics - Parallel Universes, Procreation that takes 3 individuals of a species instead of 2, Life on Moon - and he has done full justice to each one of them.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/6052014-jayesh-salvi">View all my reviews</a></div>
