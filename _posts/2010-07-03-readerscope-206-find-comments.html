If you didn't notice, in recent releases the Digg and Reddit social beacons were missing. They were removed some time ago to make space for a better method of discovering comments. I had released a stand-alone app <a href="http://jyro.blogspot.com/2010/03/new-app-find-comments.html">FindComments</a> few weeks ago. It uses ContextVoice to find comments from all sources (Twitter, Digg, Reddit, and many more). In v2.0.6 that app is integrated with ReaderScope. You will see a new icon on the action panel, which you can tap to find comments on the current news item from all over the web.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_W6UcJjyXr24/TC7rJ7EERWI/AAAAAAAADpM/zMf1TbZniYk/s1600/screenshot2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_W6UcJjyXr24/TC7rJ7EERWI/AAAAAAAADpM/zMf1TbZniYk/s320/screenshot2.png" /></a></div><br />Try it on some popular news stories from Slashdot or XKCD to see how it works.</div>

The ContextVoice list UI could use a design overhaul, its very cramped and hard to follow and read through. But good idea anyway.</div>
