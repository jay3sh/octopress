This is cool. Goto www.googlefor.com and Enter the name you would like to see instead of the 'Rainbow Google' logo on your google homepage. Hit create and check out the link it generates.
<br />
<br />Only downside. The search results generated although powered by google, don't give all the exact features that google offers on its search results page.
<br />
<br />Cool idea though.</div>
