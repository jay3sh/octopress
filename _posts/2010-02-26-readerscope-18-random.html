Just pushed out v1.8 of <a href="http://www.altcanvas.com/android/readerscope">ReaderScope</a>. Added a new feature after a long optimization-bugfix cycles in v1.7.x.<br /><br />When I added home screen widget in ReaderScope, I realized how convenient it was to directly jump to the news items from the home screen, instead of opening the app and sliding through two screens. Typically during a news reading session we want to go through all the new items in all our favorite feeds. We don't necessarily care in what order. So to ease this use case, ReaderScope 1.8 introduces "<b>Random</b>".<br /><br />When you open RS you will see a new label named "Random" at the top. When you tap on the arrow next to this label, you will directly jump to a news item. You can then use down arrow button to go to the next randomly chosen news item.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_W6UcJjyXr24/S4jLqflu6TI/AAAAAAAADlk/5pfkEfHXi88/s1600-h/screenshot1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_W6UcJjyXr24/S4jLqflu6TI/AAAAAAAADlk/5pfkEfHXi88/s320/screenshot1.png" /></a></div><br />Now here is a killer. When you tap on the widget on home screen, you will be taken directly to the news item which will also have up-down arrows. It will work the same way mentioned above. In other words, you may go through all your unread news items without opening the full ReaderScope app. Just place the widget on home screen. (Note that, the full widget functionality is only available if you have the <a href="http://market.altcanvas.com/readerscope">value pack</a> installed. It's just $2.49. What are you waiting for? :)<br /><br />Go ahead, update to v1.8 and let me know what you think.<br /><br />And yes, do you want a FREE unlock code for the value pack. The <b>Promotional Offer #2</b> is on for this weekend. First 5 people who twit about ReaderScope will get FREE unlock codes in email. It's not necessary to say only nice things, just twit your opinion about @readerscope and you will qualify for the offer. You can do this from inside the app too. Just go to <i>Settings -&gt; Spread the Word</i> and you will know what to do.<br /><br /><i>P.S. I also fixed a database update issue in this release, which may concern few users who are upgrading from very old RS version (like &nbsp;pre1.3)</i></div>
