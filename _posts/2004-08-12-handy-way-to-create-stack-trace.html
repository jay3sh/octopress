It is many times desirable while debugging to know how the program flow came to this point of execution? I found this handy way of doing that. Insert:
<br />
<br /><span style="font-family:courier new;color:#009900;">new Throwable().printStackTrace();</span>
<br /><span style="font-family:Courier New;"></span>
<br /><span >Exceptions are not always bad !!! ;)</span>
<br /></div>
