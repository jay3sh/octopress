Last night I came across <a href="http://maemo.org/profile/view/khertan">Benoît HERVIER</a>'s Maemo App <a href="http://maemo.org/downloads/product/OS2007/pygtkeditor/">PyGTKEditor</a>. That finished my search for a simple text editor tool for Maemo written in Python. I was aware of how simple it was to write a client for Google's blogger.com using the python bindings of its GData protocol. So I was in search of a very simple text editor that I could tweak to write a Blogger client for Maemo.<br /><br />PyGTKEditor is a very well written application. It is meant for writing/viewing source code written in variety of languages with syntax highlighting. It was very easy to trim it down to suit my needs and rewire it with <a href="http://gdata-python-client.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/blogger/BloggerExample.py">sample code</a> that came with GData bindings.<br /><br />And here I have a working application that is suitable for micro-blogging from Nokia tablets. I have split it into 2 packages:<br /><br />Latest Google gdata python bindings bundled into a .deb package and the blog editor itself. Here are the links:<br /><a href="http://www.altcanvas.com/packages/gdata-python_1.0.10.1.deb">gdata-python</a><br /><a href="http://www.altcanvas.com/packages/maemo-blogger_0.1.deb">maemo-blogger</a><br /><br />I will organize this into a project if this gets bigger. For now, let me know your feedback.<br /><br />P.S. If you liked this, check out another <a href="http://code.google.com/p/altcanvas/wiki/MaemoPublishr">Maemo App</a> I released yesterday.</div>

Interesting article as for me. It would be great to read something more concerning this topic. The only thing that blog misses is a <a href="http://www.jammer-store.com/images/product_images/popup_images/45_0.jpg" rel="nofollow">photo</a> of some device.</div>

Hi guys!<BR/><BR/>Finally I put together all the stuff and added some more to get a decent app running.<BR/><BR/>I named it <B>etherpad</B>. It's hosted on Google code. In addition to blogger, it lets you save documents to Google docs as well!<BR/><BR/>Check it out <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/etherpad/" REL="nofollow">here</A><BR/><BR/>Download the v0.1 from Downloads section.</div>

Thanks Dave. I do plan to update this app.  Yes, I will improve the UI so that multiple blogs for same user account will be listed to choose from. I am planning to create a more formal version of this project in coming days. Considering my schedule, the new version should be available around mid-feb.</div>

jayesh,<BR/><BR/>Very nice little app you have started.  I am looking forward to some updates as they come.  I run multiple blogs beyond tech.bucstradewinds.net, so I have a couple questions:<BR/>Will an option for which blog to post to be available in the future?  (Currently the most recent posted to blog gets the post)  <BR/>Will hyperlinks be allowed in the future?</div>

Both gdata-python and maemo-blogger installed fine, but when I choose maemo blogger from the extras menu, nothing happens.<BR/><BR/>I shut down and restarted the device,  and tried re-running it, with the same result -- no visible UI or error messages.<BR/><BR/>N800, OS2008.</div>

Mirko, the only requirement is python2.5 runtime. It should work, but I have only tested it on bora/os2007. When the installation fails, you can click on the 'Details' button (not sure if it's different in os2008) to see the cause of error. If you can report what error message you get there, that will be helpful.</div>
