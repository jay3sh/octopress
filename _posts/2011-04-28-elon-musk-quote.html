<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Some original thoughts I've heard about running a company (from the latest <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_19/b4227076914379.htm">Elon Musk interview</a>)<br /><br /><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;">I run both [electric car company] Tesla (<a href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=TSLA" style="color: #007cd5; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px; text-decoration: underline;">TSLA</a>) and SpaceX myself. It's a heavy workload, and I've never really wanted to run companies. Unfortunately, I came to the conclusion I was better than the CEOs we hired. If I'm not CEO, I can't make the inventions happen in the way they need to happen. Professional managers—MBA CEOs—are not very creative or adaptable, and their skills don't suit a startup. Business is like a multidimensional probabilistic chessboard. The rules aren't set, and the same moves don't always make you win. A lot of people can be really good in a set-piece battle; my biggest differentiating skill is I can invent new pieces.</span></blockquote>When you think you are better than others, admit it.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
