I always enjoy watching commercials that are genuinely thoughtful. I saw this one today on TV and just loved it.<br /><br />The prime goal of a commercial is to capture the viewer's attention. These days ad-campaigns achieve this by showing something bizzare at the beginning of the commercial, however irrelevant that is with respect to the actual product. Then they do some lame spins on words (Comcast commercials) or some equally stupid things to justify themselves. Rarely seen are the commercials that show some innovation. Generally a good ad should start with a surprising, interesting scene and all the way should keep the viewer wondering about its subject. It is at the end where it differs from other mediocre commercials. It has to reveal the actual product in such a manner that it just fits the concept. It only helps to have a subtle climax.<br /><br />This ad is an excellent example.<br /><br /><br /><object height="355" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/npQC7v73TXg&amp;rel=1"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/npQC7v73TXg&amp;rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="355" width="425"></embed></object></div>
