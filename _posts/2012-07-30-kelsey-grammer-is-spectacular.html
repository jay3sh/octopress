After watching 11 seasons of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VDDE18/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000VDDE18&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=codeovertones-blog-20">Frasier</a>, I couldn't imagine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Grammer">Kelsey Grammer</a> could be anyone but a comedian. When I watched <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005S97ULU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005S97ULU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=codeovertones-blog-20">Boss</a> I was glad to be wrong. The character of Tom Kane is as diametrically opposite of Frasier as possible and Kelsey has packed it with genuine terror of the scale I have rarely seen.</div>
