Last night I watched "The Cove". It is the Oscar winning documentary of this year. But more importantly it is deeply disturbing.<br /><br />Taiji is a fishing town in Japan. As shown in the movie, it is the biggest supplier of dolphins to the aquariums all over the world. A group of fishermen in this town, herds thousands of dolphin to the shore in the hunting season. The aquarium buyers hand pick a few from this lot and fly them out. At this point one would hope, the remaining dolphins are released back to the ocean. Hardly so. The remaining dolphins are pushed into a Cove. The natural terrain keeps this Cove hidden from public view. The fishermen put 'Do not enter' signs and aggressively restrict access to this area. This is the place where they mercilessly kill all the dolphins.<br /><br />The documentary is about how a group of Dolphin lovers managed to sneak cameras into this Cove and film the gruesome act.<br /><br />At this point, let me clarify that I am not a vegetarian. I eat meat and fish. In my opinion, it is not inhuman to not be at the bottom of food pyramid.<br /><br />But what makes the Dolphin killing in Taiji inhuman is, the dolphin meat it produces is rich in Mercury, hence poisonous and hence banned from many places. Yet the fishermen kill those dolphins under the pretense of tradition and under the dubious claim that it saves fish from being eaten by Dolphin hence is good for fishery business. Moreover they sell the dolphin meat as whale meat. (All the facts are based on what I saw in the documentary and not any additional research on my part. But considering the evidence shown for most of these facts, it is truly outrageous)</div>
