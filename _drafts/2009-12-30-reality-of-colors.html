Few days back I read an excellent article, titled "The Science of Avatar". It is a great analysis of the movie from scientific point of view. If you liked the movie, you should check out the article.<br /><br />In that article, the author explained the meaning of colors in a way that I never had imagined before. Here is the quote:<br /><br /><blockquote>In fact, colors are really something manufactured in our brain –&nbsp;physically colors are just different wavelengths of light ranging&nbsp;uniformly from short wavelengths (violet) to long (red). What we see&nbsp;as blue or green or red helps us differentiate sky from grass from&nbsp;blood, but to a creature from another world, all these things might&nbsp;appear as the same color. In fact, you could imagine that bats might&nbsp;use echolocation to “see” rough surfaces as one color and smooth&nbsp;surfaces as another. So since colors are something created by our&nbsp;brains and not intrinsic to the universe (only wavelengths of light&nbsp;are), it is virtually certain Pandorans would see color differently&nbsp;than we do.</blockquote><br />So there is no Red, no Green, no Blue. It only exists in our brain. Wow! We already live in a Matrix. A simulation which gives us joy by interpreting different wavelength lights in different ways. So if some alien race tommorrow finds our artwork, they might as well see blank slates.</div>
