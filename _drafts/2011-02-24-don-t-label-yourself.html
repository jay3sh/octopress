<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Don't call yourself a CEO - You'll find excuse to not write code.<br />Don't call yourself a CTO - You might overlook a potential market.<br />Don't call yourself a Coder - You just might forget what your users want.<br />Don't call yourself a Designer - You'll shy away from that little hack to improve the performance ten folds<br />Don't call yourself a Tester - You can't be one without also being other things<br /><br />The moment you put a label on yourself, you tend do things that others with the same label do.<br /><br />Go do what you feel like doing when you wake up in the morning and let it label you.</div></div>
